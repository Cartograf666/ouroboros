"""The Claudexor three-platform gate's own logic, under the ordinary suite.

Only the parts that do not need a daemon: the path-shape guard, the request shape,
the on-disk mutation evidence, and the honesty block the summary carries. The
transport itself is what the CI job exercises; testing it here would mean mocking
the thing under test.

The path-shape test is the one that earns its keep. This repository has already been
bitten by a `$HOME`-MEMBERSHIP guard on Windows, where the runner's temp directory
lives under the user profile and membership therefore passes for paths a POSIX guard
rejects. The gate's own guard is by string shape, and these tests pin that.
